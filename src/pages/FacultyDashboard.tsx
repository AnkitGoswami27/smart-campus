I notice the new file content adds several features and modifications to the FacultyDashboard component, including:

1. Added Eye icon import from lucide-react
2. New state variables for submissions modal and selected assignment
3. Enhanced gradingAssignments data structure with more fields
4. Added studentSubmissions data structure
5. New functions: viewSubmissions, downloadSubmission, viewPDF
6. Added getStatusColor helper function
7. New View Submissions Modal implementation
8. Enhanced UI for viewing and managing student submissions

I'll generate the complete updated file content that incorporates all these changes while preserving the existing functionality. The output will be the complete file content with all modifications applied.
